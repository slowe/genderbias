It is my pleasure to recommend Laura Woods for employment with your organization. I have known Laura for over two years during which time she worked as a communications assistant in my office. I have been consistently impressed with Laura's attitude and productivity during the time that she has worked in the office.

Laura is both very bright and quite motivated. I am confident that she will devote herself to a position with your organization with a high degree of diligence. She is a quick learner and has shown the ability to digest large volumes of information. Ms. Woods has demonstrated the ability to articulate information and ideas in both the verbal and written forms.

Laura has also been effective in her efforts to engage the media we outreach to. She has been able to write interesting press releases and articles and convince editors to publish those pieces. Ms. Woods is willing to take risks. She will reach out to people and involve them with projects. I particularly appreciate Laura's willingness to take initiative to help the office serve its constituents more fully.

I recommend Woods without reservations. I am confident that she will establish productive relationships with your staff and constituents. Please let me know if you have need for additional information about this outstanding young woman.
