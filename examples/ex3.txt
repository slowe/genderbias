I was initially impressed with Sharon Westman's enthusiasm, communication skills and professional demeanor when I hired her four years ago as a customer service rep within JRW Inc.'s call center. During the two years Sharon reported to me (I have since moved on to a different department), she consistently demonstrated all of these qualities and more, and I heartily endorse her for any customer service position.

Sharon is reliable, dedicated and eternally upbeat. Her ability to calm angry or frustrated customers is unparalleled, and it is because of her excellence in this area that I repeatedly asked her to mentor new employees in the call center. Sharon multitasks effectively and is able to handle a high-volume workload. She consistently met or surpassed all weekly call center metrics (including customer satisfaction, call volume and response time), and her daily written reports were accurate and thorough.

Of particular value to me as a former call center manager was Sharon's team player mind-set, enthusiastic embrace of change, ability to work with minimal supervision and unwavering commitment to exceeding customer expectations. I regularly received unsolicited praise from customers commending Sharon's outstanding level of service, professionalism and follow-through.

Organized and diligent, Sharon quickly learned technology systems and software that were unfamiliar to her when she first started with JRW, and she also attended optional professional-development seminars offered through the company. She is pursuing an associate's degree in business through evening classes at ABC Community College.

Sharon is a hardworking, top-performing customer service professional. She has my highest recommendation, and I am happy to furnish more details if you would like additional information.
